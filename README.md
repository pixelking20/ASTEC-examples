# ASTEC-Parsing

This repository contains the notebook that was used to parse the cell lineages and gather the needed data for Ruvinsky Lab at Northwestern University

The datasets are not included in this repository for space reasons. They can be accessed and downloaded at https://figshare.com/collections/Contact-area_dependent_cell_communications_and_the_morphological_invariance_of_ascidian_embryogenesis/4529990/2.

## I - CONTENTS OF THE  REPOSITORY
  - ASTEC-JupyterNotebook.ipynb: The notebook for parsing the data from guignard et all
  - Data: folder place-holder where the necessary datas to build the figures should be placed
  - CSVOutput: the folder where the notebook outputs the parsed data into CSV files. All the CSV files are posted for ease of reference and storage
  - LICENCE: the licence terms you accept by using the notebook
  - README.md: this file 
  - useful_functions.py: Set of useful functions to handle the data and make figures. Some of them are used in this notebook

## II - INSTALLATION AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
In order to be able to run the notebook you need to install several packages:
  * python 2.7 or higher, 3.7 or higher (https://www.python.org/)
  * numpy,scipy,matplotlib, different scientific packages for python (http://www.numpy.org, http://www.scipy.org, http://matplotlib.org)
  * jupyter notebook, a open-source framework to share code (http://jupyter.org)

## III - RUNNING ASTEC-examples
The code is written in python and can easly be run with a web interface using a Notebook (http://jupyter.org). 

You can find a user interface tutorial here (http://jupyter.cs.brynmawr.edu/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb)

To start the notebook, open a terminal and  run the command `jupyter notebook path/to/Package/ASTEC-JupyterNotebook.ipynb`

most of this readme is from the forked repository.
